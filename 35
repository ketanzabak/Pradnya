Consider the psudo code given below. The function DoSomething() takes 
as argument a pointer to the root of an aribtrary tree represented by
the leftMostChild-rightSibling representation. Each node of the tree
is of type treeNode. 

typedef struct treeNode* treeptr;

struct treeNode{
	treeptr leftMostChild, rightSibling;
};

int DoSomething(treeptr tree)
{
	int value = 0;
	if(tree != NULL)
	{
	if(tree->leftMostChild == NULL)
		value = 1;
	else
		value = DoSomething(tree->leftMostChild);
		
	value = value + DoSomething(tree->rightSibling);
	}
	return (value);
}

When the pointer to the root of the tree is passed as the argument to 
DoSomething(), the value return by the function corresponds to the

$a) Number of Internal nodes in the tree.
$b) Height of the tree.
$c) Number of nodes without rightSibling 
	in the tree.
$d) Number of leaf nodes in the tree.
$4
